# Seafood Consumption Data

Seafood consumption refers to the average availability of fish and seafood for human consumption, expressed in kilograms per person per year. This metric reflects the food supply remaining after accounting for non-food uses, such as exports, industrial applications, animal feed, and losses along the distribution chain, from production to retail. It includes a wide range of seafood types, such as fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and mollusks. 

While the measure accounts for wastage during distribution, it excludes waste at the consumption level, such as household or restaurant waste, leading to a potential overestimation of actual consumption.

## Data Availability

This dataset is sourced from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) via OWID and FAO, under its 'new methodology' of Food Balance Sheets; and the data are combined into a complete series from 1961 to 2018. 

- **Original Data:** No transformations have been made to the original data both from OWID and FAO. 
- **Definition of Food Supply:** Food supply is defined as food available for human consumption. At the country level, it is calculated as the food remaining for human use after deduction of all non-food utilizations:  
  `food = production + imports + stock withdrawals − exports − industrial use − animal feed − seed − wastage − additions to stock`
- **Wastage:** Includes losses of usable products occurring along distribution chains from farm gate (or port of import) up to the retail level. However, such values do not include consumption-level waste (e.g., retail, restaurant, and household waste) and therefore overestimate the average amount of food actually consumed.
- **Timeline:** Gapminder imported data from FAO via OWID from 1961 to 2017, and FAO food balance data for the year 2018. 
- **Coverage:** Data is presented only for countries/territories, regions, and global per year.
